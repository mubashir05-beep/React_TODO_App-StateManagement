# React_TODO_App-StateManagement

# React Todo-App
**Features:**

    Create: Users can easily create new tasks by entering the task name in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
    Read:   Users can view their tasks in a list format, with each task displaying its name, status (in progress or complete), and options to edit or delete the task.
    Update: Users can edit tasks by clicking the "Edit" button, which opens a modal with an input field to modify the task name. Once the changes are made,   users can save the updated task.
    Delete: Users can delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button, which removes the task from the list of tasks.
  
            Mark in progress/complete: Users can mark tasks as in progress or complete by clicking the corresponding buttons next to each task. This visually indicates the status of the task.
    State management: The app uses state management techniques in React, such as useState and useEffect hooks, to handle the state of tasks and manage the CRUD operations.
